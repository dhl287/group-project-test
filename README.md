# PokeWeather Alert

## Description

We created a website that allows users to search a city name to review any current weather alerts in that city for the purposes of travel, to check on loved ones living there, or simply out of curiosity.

## Installation

Our group used the Weatherbit API to fetch weather alerts and Poke API to fetch Pokemon characters to use in conjunction with weather alerts. We utilized the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. Finally, JQuery, a JavaScript library, was utilized to aid with event handling, animation, etc.

## Usage

The website header is displayed across the top, and it includes the website’s name. Below the header, a search field along with a “Go” and “Clear” buttons are displayed in a linear fashion. Below the search bar, five Pokeballs are displayed. They reveal specific characters according to the type(s) of weather alerts for a given location. Alerts are displayed between the search field and the Pokeballs. Previous search history for other cities is displayed and hyperlinked in a section below the Pokeballs. The footer displays links to the contributors’ repositories.

When the user types in the name of a city in the search field, they will either click “enter” on their keyboard or the “Go” button to generate that specific city’s weather alert. The Pokemon game theme song will play in the background and the weather alert will appear under the search field.. Depending on the type of weather alert, one of the five Pokeballs will transform into a specific Pokemon character. 

If the city has a heat-related alert, Charizard will appear.

Once the user has reviewed the alert, they will click the “Clear” button to clear the search field. The searched city will then appear in the “Search History” section. When the user clicks any of the cities listed in the “Search History” section, the alert for that city will appear.
